-- If you copy the code please leave credits to us in any way even if No one would see it it should be possible
   to acces it without having to open any files. What is meant with that is that they should have the options in the
   settings for example to open the Credits.

-- If you want to use this without any Credits, you can. Just Note that you would be Helping a small Coder. Even without
   Credits or any Proof that you took the code we still take no Damages.
